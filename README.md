# Multi object tracking for autonomous systems

This repository includes multi object tracking algorithms based on Bayesian theory. PDA, PHA and PMBM filters are implemented. The code was developed during the study of [https://www.edx.org/course/multi-object-tracking-for-automotive-systems](https://www.edx.org/course/multi-object-tracking-for-automotive-systems)
